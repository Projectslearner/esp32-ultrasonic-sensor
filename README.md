# ESP32 Ultrasonic Sensor Project

### Project Overview
The ESP32 Ultrasonic Sensor project demonstrates how to interface an ultrasonic sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller to measure distance based on the time it takes for sound waves to travel to an object and back. This project is commonly used in robotics and automation for obstacle avoidance and distance measurement applications.

### Components Needed
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Used to interface with the ultrasonic sensor and process distance measurements.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures distance by sending ultrasonic waves and calculating the time it takes for the waves to bounce back.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32.
- **Breadboard**: Optional, for organizing circuit connections if needed.

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Ultrasonic Sensor to ESP32:**
   - **TRIG Pin**: Connect to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 13).
   - **ECHO Pin**: Connect to another GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 12).

### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize Serial communication using `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging purposes.
   - Set pinMode for `trigPin` as OUTPUT and `echoPin` as INPUT to interface with the ultrasonic sensor.

2. **Operation:**
   - **Triggering Ultrasonic Waves:**
     - Generate a short pulse on the `trigPin` to initiate the ultrasonic signal.
   - **Measuring Distance:**
     - Measure the duration of the pulse received on the `echoPin` using `pulseIn()` function.
     - Calculate the distance based on the duration of the pulse and the speed of sound.
     - Print the distance to the Serial Monitor.

3. **Output:**
   - Continuously display the distance measurements.
   - Distance is measured in centimeters (cm).

4. **Considerations:**
   - **Speed of Sound:** Adjust the `speedOfSound` constant if operating in a different environment where the speed of sound varies.
   - **Measurement Accuracy:** Ensure the sensor is calibrated and positioned correctly for accurate distance readings.
   - **Obstacle Detection:** Use distance measurements for obstacle detection and navigation in robotics applications.

### Applications
- **Robotics:** Implement for obstacle avoidance and navigation in autonomous robots.
- **Smart Devices:** Use in smart devices for proximity sensing and gesture recognition.
- **Industrial Automation:** Monitor distances in industrial automation processes.
